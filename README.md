# kilter-board

The Kilterboard is a standardized training tool for climbers.
It is a wall with an adjustable angle and screwed on holds
with LEDs which allows users to create their own climb and
comes in various sizes.

Climbs come with various levels of difficulties (grades). These
are initially set by the creater of the climb (setter) and users
who complete the climb can also submit their own grades to help
come to a concensus.

We shall use the data from the Kilterboard in order to develop a
model that can accurately grade climbs. Although the Kilterboard
boosts a large repository of climbs (almost 200,000), most users
only attempt the most popular climbs which can have up to 40,000+
ascents while a large portion of climbs have less than 5 ascents.

This hurts the user experience since some setters do not grade
their climbs accurately due to inexperience or lack of
climbing ability/knowledge. However if these climbs remain
unpopular, it is unlikely if a wrong grade will be changed as
there will not be enough user-submitted ratings to correct
the error.

This model will not only allow setters to set and grade climbs
more accurately but will also give the larger userbase access to
more climbs in their desired difficulty range outside of the most
popular climbs which users rely on due to their accurate grades.
